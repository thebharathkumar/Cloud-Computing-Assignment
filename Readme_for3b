# Image Analysis with Azure Cognitive Services

This Python script demonstrates how to perform image analysis using Azure Cognitive Services API. The script analyzes an image provided via a URL and retrieves information such as categories, description, and dominant color.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Setup

1. Obtain an Azure Cognitive Services API endpoint and subscription key for the Vision service.
2. Replace the `endpoint` and `subscription_key` variables in the script with your own values.
3. Provide the URL of the image you want to analyze by replacing the `image_url` variable.
4. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already by running `pip install requests`.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python.
2. The script will send a POST request to the Azure Cognitive Services API, providing the image URL and request parameters.
3. The API will analyze the image and return the results in the response.
4. If the response status code is 200 (OK), the script will extract and print the following information:
   - Categories: The categories or objects detected in the image.
   - Description: A caption or description of the image.
   - Dominant Color: The dominant color in the image.
5. If there is an error, the script will print the response status code and reason.
